# iPhone Notifications

This software will run on Windows 10.

The software makes use of ANCS (Apple Notifications Center Service) to get the notifications 
from your IPhone into the Windows Activity Center through Toast Notifications.

On your iPhone you will need a BLE software such as `LightBlue`or `Aha NP` in order to bind 
your computer to the ANCS on your iPhone.
